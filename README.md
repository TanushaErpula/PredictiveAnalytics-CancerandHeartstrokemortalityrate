# Predictive Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains predictive analytics project on Cancer mortality and heart stroke death datasets. The main objective is to build predictive models for healthcare data provided by a Boston healthcare company aiming to address global causes of death. Two distinct datasets were explored and analyzed to build predictive models to understand and forecast stroke and cancer death rates.

## Datasets
1. **Cancer Dataset**: Comprising 3047 rows and 34 columns, this dataset was analyzed to understand various factors contributing to cancer mortality rates.
2. **Stroke Dataset**: Containing 5110 rows and 12 columns, this dataset was used to analyze and predict stroke occurrences based on different health and demographic factors.

## Predictive Models
Various predictive models were built and evaluated including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. 

### Cancer Dataset:
- **Linear Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 90% with an R-squared value of 0.524.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Attained an accuracy of 83% with a Mean Squared Error of 543.829.

### Stroke Dataset:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 95% with a Mean Squared Error of 0.091.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Attained an accuracy of 94% with a Mean Squared Error of 0.056.

## Installation and Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that all requisite libraries and dependencies are installed.
- Navigate to the respective project folders and run the Jupyter Notebooks to view the analysis and models.

## Results
- Recommended the Linear Regression model for predicting death rates due to cancer.
- Advised using the Decision Tree Classifier for predicting stroke occurrences.

## Conclusion
These predictive models can significantly aid healthcare professionals and insurance companies in understanding and addressing health risks, thereby potentially saving lives and optimizing healthcare delivery.
